# program starts here - igonore what is above

# A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or
# pointer to an object. Variables can later on be refered to
# within the program by their names and can be assinged
# values.

first_name = "Njoh Noh"  # variable first_name
last_name = "Prince Junior"  # variable last_name

print(first_name)  # prints the data container within the variable first_name
print(last_name)  # prints the data container within the variable last_name

# Examples of Variable Naming conventions

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, firstName and FirstName are three different variables)

# Good naming conventions

FirstName = "Njoh Noh"  # pascal casing -can be confusing when using classes
firstName = "Njoh Noh"  # camel casing
first_name = "Njoh Noh"  # snake casing -preferred
_firstName = "Njoh Noh"

# Bad or illegal naming conventions

# ðŸ‘‡ delete the leading hashes then run and observe the error
# 2firstName = "Njoh Noh"
# first-name = "Njoh Noh"
# first name = "Njoh Noh"
