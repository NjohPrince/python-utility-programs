# Encapsulation

# Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions that work on that data
# within a single object. By doing so, you can hide the internal state of
# the object from the outside. This is known as information hiding.

# A class is an example of encapsulation.
# A class bundles data and methods into a single unit.
# And a class provides the access to its attributes via methods.

# The idea of information hiding is that if you have an attribute that isnâ€™t
# visible to the outside, you can control the access to its value to make
# sure your object is always has a valid state.
